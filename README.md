# Quiz Quiz
(Developer: Bilan Mykhailo)

The site presents a quiz in which the user can test their knowledge in several disciplines: nature, history, geography and logic. The user's action is to select the correct answer to the question asked. At the end of the quiz, the result that the user has achieved is displayed. Also, the user can leave feedback on a separate page of the site by filling out the feedback form.

### Design Choices

The site is designed to maximize the interest of users by the simplicity and use of its use. The design of the site is designed in such a way that the user can quickly and easily figure out how to use the site and easily get the desired result (the ability to play a quiz).

### Colors

For the text content of the header and footer of the site, a white color was chosen, which contrasts well with the dark background. For the text content of the main block, black was chosen to contrast well with the green background. Orange was chosen for the hover effects. I used Adobe Color to select the color.
